      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a former accountant and now software engineer from App Academy who has experience building full-stack web applications. 
      Whether it's building a backend to handle data or building a frontend to display a beautiful app, I welcome all challenges a project may present. 
      My past experiences highlight my abilities to thrive in fast-paced environments and work well independently and collaboratively.
